# 🌿 HabitFlow

**HabitFlow** is a minimal and responsive web application that helps you stay consistent with your daily habits while keeping an eye on your expenses — all in one place.  
It’s designed for people who want a simple, distraction-free way to build habits and track spending, without needing an account or any setup.

Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it runs entirely in your browser and saves your data locally.

### 💡 About the Project

The idea behind *HabitFlow* is to bring habit building and expense tracking together in one simple tool.  
Most apps focus on just one — but in reality, both are part of your daily discipline.  

I created this project to improve my front-end development skills and understand how to build a fully functional web app from scratch, with features like persistent local storage, dynamic rendering, and data visualization.
