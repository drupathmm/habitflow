# 🌿 HabitFlow

**HabitFlow** is a clean and responsive web app that helps you stay consistent with your daily habits while keeping track of your daily expenses — all in one simple interface.  
It’s designed for anyone who wants to improve consistency, track progress, and manage spending without signing up or installing anything.

### 💡 About the Project

The idea behind *HabitFlow* is simple — to combine **habit tracking** and **expense tracking** into one easy-to-use tool.  
While most apps focus on one or the other, HabitFlow gives you both — helping you build discipline and awareness every day.

This project was built as part of my web development journey.  
The main focus was on writing clean JavaScript logic, using browser storage efficiently, and building a responsive layout that looks good on any device.
