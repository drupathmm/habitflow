# 🌿 HabitFlow

### 💡 Project Overview  

Most apps focus on either habits or finances — *HabitFlow* combines both.  
It lets you manage your routines and spending side by side, giving you a simple way to build consistency and financial awareness every day.

This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development.  
It focuses on writing clean, maintainable code, using browser storage effectively, and building smooth, responsive UI components without any frameworks.
