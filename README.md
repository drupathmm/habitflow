# 🌿 HabitFlow

**HabitFlow** is a simple and modern web application that helps you stay consistent with your daily habits and keep track of your everyday expenses.  
It’s built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with data stored locally in your browser — so everything works instantly, without any login or server setup.

### 💡 About the Project

The main idea behind HabitFlow is to combine **habit tracking** and **expense tracking** in one clean interface.  
Most apps focus on one thing — either productivity or finance — but HabitFlow brings both together, helping users build discipline while staying aware of their spending habits.

I built this project as part of my personal learning journey in web development.  
The goal was to strengthen my front-end skills, learn to manage data in the browser using `localStorage`, and understand how to visualize information using **Chart.js**.
